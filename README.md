Hello this is my first react project!
This is a working Video-Call website that can allow you to join call with anyone else as well as send messages betwen a live chat.
We modeled the design based off Google Meet's style, but 100% of the code in this project was made by us.
I started this project here but when we moved to colaborate the project also moved to [Eric](https://github.com/Eponce11/Spotify-Clone).
This project was a whole lot of fun and there will definitely be more from us in the future!
